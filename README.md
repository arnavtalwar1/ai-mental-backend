### 3️⃣ Add installation instructions (optional but good)
In each repo, make sure you have:
- **Backend:** a `requirements.txt` file with your Python dependencies.
- **Frontend:** a `package.json` (it’s already there if it’s a React project).

Anyone can then clone and run:
```bash
# backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# frontend
npm install
npm start
